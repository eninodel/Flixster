Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Constraint layouts for styling grid cells better
2. Auto refresh every X minutes to stay up to date with the current selection of movies / data

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had challenges in making the serach bar because I had to go beyond the Codepath help and search into the actual developers documentation to implement it correctly. I also had a challenge passing data to the table cells at the beginning but it was easy once I understood it correctly.
